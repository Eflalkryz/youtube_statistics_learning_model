# youtube_statistics_learning_model
It estimates the average salary of youtubers based on their information per month. Firstly I made data analyse and preproccessing in first step. I find Na's and use KNN Algorithm to find values ​​that fit the blank. It fills the numerical values. However I also have categorical values. Therefore, I fill NA with Mode values of column. I reviewed the data and made specific evaluations for each gap. I used visualization methods and compared a lot of data with graphs. In the following stages, I wanted to create an image with the name of the most watched youtuber on each country on a map. I didn't have much expertise in this field, but with a little research, I prepared an outline. Using the 'Longitude' and 'attitude' values ​​in the data, I placed each youtuber in their place on the map.
Finally I start to make hyperparameter analysis and find the correct parameters for GBM Model.

At this stage, I had to do long trials because the correlations of some data were so high that only one value appeared in the plot importance and it seemed that there was an overfit in the complexity matrix. I get this result at final. There is still much to be improved so I am open to comments and suggestions at this stage.
